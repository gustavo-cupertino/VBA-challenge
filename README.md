  this module should run the script on all sheets at once. 
  
alphabetical_testing_Solved GPfinal.xlsm
  this is the testing database while writing the script. 
  

Note: I couldn't run the script on the actual assigment file named "Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsm". I tried several times but my computer kept stop responding. Reason why I could not submit the screenshots.
